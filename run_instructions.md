# How to Run the ChatGPT Archive Search Tool

Since Python isn't available in the current environment, here are the steps to run this application on your local machine:

## Option 1: Run Locally (Recommended)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system
- Your ChatGPT archive in the `ChatGPT chats/ChatGPT chats` directory

### Steps

1. **Save all the files** I created to a folder on your computer:
   - `app.py`
   - `requirements.txt` 
   - `README.md`
   - `templates/base.html`
   - `templates/index.html`

2. **Open Command Prompt or Terminal** in that folder

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask PyYAML Werkzeug
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Option 2: Test with Sample Data

If you want to test the search functionality first, I can create a simplified version that works with sample data.

## Option 3: Standalone Script

I can create a command-line version that doesn't require Flask if you prefer a simpler approach.

## Expected Output

When you run `python app.py`, you should see:
```
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Running on http://[your-ip]:5000
```

Then you can open the web interface and start searching your ChatGPT archive!

## Troubleshooting

- **"Module not found" errors**: Make sure you installed the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **"No such file or directory"**: Ensure your ChatGPT archive is in the correct path relative to the app
- **Port already in use**: Change the port in `app.py` from 5000 to another number like 5001

## Features You Can Test

1. **Basic Search**: Try searching for common terms like "python", "code", "help"
2. **Exact Phrases**: Use quotes like `"machine learning"`
3. **Boolean Logic**: Test ALL vs ANY term matching
4. **Exclusions**: Use the exclude field to filter out unwanted results
5. **Date Filtering**: Set date ranges to limit results
6. **Export**: Try exporting results to CSV or JSON
