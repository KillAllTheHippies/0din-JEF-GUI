## üîß Troubleshooting

-   **"Module not found" errors:** Ensure you have installed all dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
-   **Port already in use:** You can change the port by editing `app.py` around line 1260: `app.run(port=5001)`.
-   **Archive not found:** Double-check the **Root Archive Folder** path in the settings. Make sure the folder contains `.md` files.
-   **JEF not found:** Verify that the **JEF Path** in the settings points to the correct directory where you cloned the `0din-JEF` repository.
